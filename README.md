1. Manage menu items: Add, edit, or delete menu items, along with their prices, descriptions, and images.

2. Manage orders: View, process, and track orders placed by customers, update order status, and communicate with customers in real-time.

3. Manage reservations: Accept, manage, and track reservations made by customers, with options for setting table availability and customizing reservation details.

4. Manage customer information: Store and manage customer information, including contact details, order history, and feedback.

5. Analytics and reporting: Generate reports on sales, order trends, customer feedback, and other metrics that help restaurant owners and managers make informed business decisions.

The use of WebSockets in the admin panel enables real-time updates for order status, reservations, and customer communication, providing a seamless experience for both restaurant staff and customers. With this feature, restaurant staff can quickly update order status, communicate with customers, and manage reservations without the need for manual refreshing.
